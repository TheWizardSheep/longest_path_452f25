O running time:
    - running time for the reduction
    - running time for LPP to run and get the answer


calling the program:


generate some graphs that do and dont have hamiltonian paths
generate a longest path input for the exact solution (ben)
answer the question if the graph has a hamiltonian path ( v- 1)
