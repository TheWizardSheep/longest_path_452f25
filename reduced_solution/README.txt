-The O running time. Be as specific as possible. For example, if you
are studying a graph problem, express the bounds in terms of V and
E (and maybe even a ratio of these values). If your problem is defined
by a number of variables and a number of clauses, be specific (m is
the number of clauses and n is the number of variables).

– An example of calling your program that works with a sample input
file. Cite the complete command line.
